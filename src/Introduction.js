        <p>I'm a software engineer based in <strong>San Francisco</strong>, currently working for <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>.</p>
        <p>I want to feel great about the software I build from a tech perspective and a human one. That means writing quality code for a purpose.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me working on my book, practicing yoga, or looking for Airbnbs in faraway places.</p>
        <p>To see more of my experience, <a href='/resume'>check out my resume</a>.</p>
